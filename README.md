# Show_Us

Would you like to be a famous singer, wrapper, or rockstar? This is the COMPETITION and STAGE for you. Don't go to Hollywood Blvd and give your demo tape to strangers.
You don't need invitations or tickets to be on a TV show like America's Got Talent, and hear criticism from Simon Cowell. 
Show Us your talent, and the world will show and tell you how much they love your performance.
Take this chance to be an artist. [Check out my App](https://show-us-test.herokuapp.com/).
